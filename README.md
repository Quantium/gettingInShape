# Getting in Shape

Excerices for getting in shape with programming

## Motivation

I've worked as CTO since 2014, that's 10 years from now whe I write this lines. My Job is much more about corporate procedures than programming. The closest I am to programming is architecture or some especific code check once in a while. And don't take me wrong, I enjoy this work a lot, I move a bunch of people and resources to create technology, mostly software, which helps a lot of people around the world.

Some time ago I realize that as CTO it's bad idea to wrote code for production purposes when your team is big enough, mainly because you will have no time to maintain and explain that code, moreover because software development is a quick growing discipline and it is very easy to keep up with the new libraries, additions to programing languages and new specific techcnologies. 

The thing is that I miss programing, software problem solving, datastructures and mostly mathematic algorithms. And I don't want to lose that ability because I could use it in the future. Also programing is fun, very fun.

Futhermore, I know that nobody reads this, at least my repos, so this is a kind of self instrospection writing(Code and English) excercise. So please, if you have any comments be kind, remember that my native language is not English and I code just once in a while. Surely for experienced day-to-day programers this repo will be silly or pretty basic, it is what it is.

## My personal Methodology

A few years ago I practice Tai-Chi daily, about 3 hours per day. I praticed alone most of the time, I watched videos and read text books about Tai-Chi to improve my abilities. It was my personal kung-fu/tai-chi trainging, a way to improve myself with any kind of comparision with others. **This is the Same**.

In this repository I practice something I like to call *katas*. It is not I created, The coding dojo methodology is widely known around the programing community and as the Tai-Chi, I'll do this alone. I'm not interested in compiting with anyone, I'm just compiting with myself.

When I haven't mastered an excercise, algorithm or datastructure yet, I let only the explanation, I erase the code every time I practiced it to force myself to figure it out again how to solve it until it came natural for me.

About the files organization. I am writing this lines in an attempt to put a little order to this repository, so, if you review the commit history you'll find that the file structure is very messy or inexistent. But I hope to fix this soon, so in the more current versions you'll find more order.
