# Getting in Shape

Exercises for getting in shape with programming

## Motivation

I've worked as CTO since 2014, that's 10 years as of when I write these lines. My job is much more about corporate procedures than programming. The closest I am to programming is architecture or some specific code check once in a while. And don't get me wrong, I enjoy this work a lot, I manage a lot of people and resources to create technology, mostly software, which helps a lot of people around the world.

Some time ago I realized that as CTO it's a bad idea to write code for production purposes when your team is big enough, mainly because you will have no time to maintain and explain that code, especifically because software development is a rapidly growing discipline and it is very difficult to keep up with the new libraries, additions to programing languages and new specific technologies. 

The thing is that I miss programming, software problem solving, datastructures and mostly mathematical algorithms. And I don't want to lose that ability because I could use it in the future. Also programming is fun, very fun.

Furthermore, I know that nobody reads this, at least my repos, so this is a kind of self instrospection excersice, writing code and english. So please, if you have any comments be kind, remember that my native language is not English and I code just once in a while. Surely for experienced day-to-day programmers this repo will be silly or pretty basic, it is what it is.

## My personal Methodology

A few years ago I practiced Tai-Chi daily, about 3 hours per day. I practiced alone most of the time, I watched videos and read textbooks about Tai-Chi to improve my abilities. It was my personal kung-fu/tai-chi training, a way to improve myself with anykind of comparision with others. **This is the same**.

In this repository I practice something I like to call *katas*, which is not something I created, The coding dojo methodology is widely known around the programming community and as with Tai-Chi, I'll do this alone. I'm not interested in competing with anyone, I'm just competing with myself.

When I haven't mastered an excersise, algorithm or datastructure yet, I let only the explanation, I erase the code every time I practiced it to force myself to figure out again how to solve it until it feels natural for me.

About the file organization. I am writing these lines in an attempt to put a little order to this repository, so, if you review the commit history you'll find that the file structure is very messy or nonexistent. But I hope to fix this soon, so in the later versions you'll find more order.
